Welcome to pyveg's documentation!
=================================

The `pyveg` package implements functionality to download and process data
from Google Earth Engine (GEE), and analyse images from periodic vegetation patterns (PVP) in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.
PVP images are quantified using
network centrality metrics. The results of the analysis can be used
to search for typical early warning signals of an ecological collapse. Google Earth Engine Editor scripts are also provided to help
researchers discover locations of ecosystems which may be in
decline.

pyveg is being developed as part of a research project looking for evidence of early warning signals of ecosystem
collapse using remote sensing data. pyveg allows such research to be carried out at scale, and hence can be an important
tool in understanding changing arid and semi-arid ecosystem dynamics.
